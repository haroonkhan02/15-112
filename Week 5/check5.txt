5. Your well-thought-out questions, and answers, one per assigned video.

1. Why doesn’t creating a 2D list with multiplication work? 
It creates aliases of the first list the amount of times the original list is multiplied by.

2. How do you get the length of the columns in a 2D list?
Create a variable equal to len(list[0]). 

3. How do you modify only the odd rows in a 2D list?
Only change an element when row%2==1.

4. What’s the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Copy.copy() creates a shallow copy while copy.deepcopy() doesn’t.

5. What does print2dlist print from a visual perspective?
It returns each list to a new row and aligns it according to the ones digit.

6. Why is it cheaper to access a row than a column?
Each row is an element in the list while you have to create a new list with all the numbers in the column.

7. How do you adjust for the length of a row?
You have to use the variable that gives the amount of rows because each row is possibly a different length. 

8. What is a 3D list and what is it used for in 112?
It is a list with three 2D lists. Tetris.

That's it!  Carpe diem!
