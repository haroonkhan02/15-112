Be *very brief* in your answers!  Seriously.  Brief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Your full name and andrew id: Sydney Howard, showard

2. The full names and andrew id's of your groupmates.  Note that if you worked solo on this, then copy-paste the timestamp line from the email
from the course instructor permitting you to do so.
Max Perry, maperry
Jenn Choi, jaeeunc1

3. Dates/times that you watched the videos listed in check3.html (fill this out as you go): 1/29/17 7:30PM-9:15PM

4. Total time this check required (fill this out when you are done): 
1 hour and 45 minutes


5. Strings questions (from the various String videos):

5.1. Why is len('a\nb') equal to 3 and not 4?
\n is a single character.

5.2. List a character that is easier to include in a string delimited by double-quotes rather than single-quotes.
A single-quote.

5.3. List each escape sequence mentioned in the video (like \n) and what they mean.
\’ means to leave the single quote in the string.
\” means to leave the double quote in the string.
\\ means that the second \ isn’t supposed to be an escape for the string.
\t means that there will be a tab.
\n means that there will be a new line.

5.4. What is type(string.digits)?  Why?
String because they are the digits able to be printed as characters.

5.5. For any string s where len(s)>1, is it definitely true that ((s[1:] in s) == True)?
True

5.6. What is the empty string?  What is its type?  What is its length?
An empty string is a string with no characters. It is a string. It has a length 0.

5.7. What is "abcde"[-1]?
e

5.8. What is 'abcde'[-1][-1]?  Briefly explain why that works, but 'abcde'[1][1] crashes.
It is ‘c.’ 'abcde'[1][1] doesn’t work because you can’t find the [1] of ‘b.’

5.9. Briefly, why did we write the function reverseString in the video, rather than just using s[::-1] in our code?
It’s less confusing than the other ways you can reverse strings.

5.10. Briefly, what is the difference between split and splitlines?
Split is a way to loop through a list if each value is separated by a comma.
Splitlines will print the sentences that start with a specific word.

5.11. Please be sure to carefully watch the videos and take time
to discuss and reflect on their content, and not just hurry through
and answer all these questions.  The point of this check is not for
you to answer the questions, but for you to learn the material.  So
please take the time to learn the material well.  Ok?
Will do.

5.12. Of the first 4 ways we solve isPalindrome, which way do you think
is the worst, and why so?
Way 4 is the worst because it uses multiple strings that are unnecessary.
It’s more confusing than it needs to be.

5.12. What does it mean that Strings are immutable?
You cannot change a string once it is created.

5.13. What is the difference between a string method and a string function?
They are almost the same, except they differ in the way you call them.
String methods are called with the format of “s.____()”. 
String functions are called with the format of ____(). 

5.14. What is the difference between chr and ord?
ord prints a number linked to a number; its accii code.
chr prints a letter linked to a its accii code.

5.15. What is the difference between lower and islower?
islower checks of the letters in a string, if they are lower case.
Lower converts a string to lower case. 

5.16. How do you left-align text using the string formatting operator?
Use a negative number.
 
5.17. Why does the Basic File IO example crash if you run it in the browser?
You need access to a Hard Drive when running it, and your browser isn’t 
connected to it.

That's it!  Carpe diem!
